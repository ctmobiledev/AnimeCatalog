 Anime Catalog App for Android

This app is a searchable database for anime films. The user can enter a character string as a search term,
tap the "Search Now" button, and see up to 50 matching entries. Tapping on any entry displays a screen with
details on the selected title.

It was a coding challenge issued by a place to which I applied to be an Android developer. It was intentionally
written as a sort of "no-frills" app. Certainly it could have been made to be more stylish but time was of
the essence in producing this particular app.

This project has the following features:

- It uses Picasso, a simple-to-use image display control. 
- It uses a Repository design pattern to implement an API call using Retrofit.

This app can be used as a basis for other similar apps, as an example of how to incorporate a JSON-based API
into a project, or as a basic demo of Kotlin skills.
